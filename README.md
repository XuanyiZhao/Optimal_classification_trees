# Optimal_classification_trees

According to the research paper published by Professor Dimitris Bertsimas and Jack Dunn in 2017, the optimal classification trees algorithm can directly create the entire tree structure to achieve global optimality.

Motivated by the rapid development of optimization theory and hardware improvements, we can present this algorithm via mixed-integer optimization now.
